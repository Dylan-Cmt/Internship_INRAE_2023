# Biomaths

The aim of my project is the development of a Julia module for seasonal epidemiology.
To do so, I proceeded in the following order:

To learn julia and to practice:  
  -Resumption of biomaths TPs . [Pluto Notebook]  
  -Development of a first module based on these TPs + application of the package BifurcationKit on the model of Rosenzweig MacArthur. [VSCode]

After that, I only work with VSCode.
